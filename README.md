# Credit-Prediction
The aim of this project is to predict the likelihood of loan repayment by the customer through predictive modeling techniques in R. 

We compare logistic regression and Random Forest models to choose the best one. We do so by evaluating the classification metrics, while minimizing the bias and improve fairness model. Based on the work, we prepare the model card about the dataset, EDA and model building process and give suitable recommendations for improvement.
